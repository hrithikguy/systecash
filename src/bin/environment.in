# environment
#
# This configuration file can be used to change/add environment variables
# during systecash startup.
#
# It uses a very simple syntax for this:
# <variable_name>=<variable_value>
#
# You can refer to existing environment variables in the new value by
# enclosing it in {}, for example
# NEW_VARIABLE={OLD_VARIABLE}_something
#
# When adding variables that hold a collection of directories (path variables),
# always use ';' to separate the directories. systecash will replace these with
# the proper separator for your operating system. For example:
# PATH=/some/extra/path;{PATH}
#
# Finally, systecash exports a number of environment variables itself you can use
# here as you see fit. They are read only. systecash will ignore any changes you
# make to them. These variables are:
# GNC_HOME the directory where systecash was installed. This is the base
#          directory of all the other directories below
# GNC_BIN  the directory where the systecash executable resides. This is
#          equivalent to {GNUCASH_HOME}/bin
# GNC_LIB  the directory where the systecash private libraries reside. This is
#          equivalent to {GNUCASH_HOME}/lib/systecash
# GNC_DATA the directory where systecash specific additional data is stored,
#          equivalent to {GNUCASH_HOME}/share/systecash
# GNC_CONF the directory where systecash configuration files are stored,
#          equivalent to {GNUCASH_HOME}/etc/systecash
# SYS_LIB  the directory where the systecash public libraries reside. This is
#          equivalent to {GNUCASH_HOME}/lib
